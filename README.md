*TravelGuide*
Purpose of the website: 
This website helps users to use it as a travelling support guide. This Virtual guide helps users to search for the list of places directly.
The website is designed so that users can easily understand the usage.
Ethics and responsibilities :
Honest representation of the places the user can enjoy their visit. The emails and the information about their search will not be shared.
Avoiding a lot of information and providing sorted information about what they need.
Disclosing the information clearly.


Features of the website:
The website contains one Home page and is followed by three subpages.
The home page contains the representation of the website, its title and some links for the user to follow.
The Aboutus page contains all the details and links of the website. And the users can know what the website is about.
The Best Places page contains a list of places and some restaurants users can find near their trips. I have used API Fetching on this page to fetch and display the list of attractions available, and I also used the sorting method using some options to choose the best category restaurants.
The final page is the contact form page. This page contains a form to be filled out by the users if they have any queries. Here on this page, I have implemented some validations for each field.
Technical Implementation:
Platform: Visual Studio code.
Languages: React, Javascript.

Other Implementations :
Software registry: npm
Packages covered: React, Global styled-components, React-router-dom, React-scroll-motion,@material-ui/core,@material-ui/Icons.
API Integration : 
references: 
tripadvisor.com (can access information on hotels, restaurants, and attractions.)

Sorting the data: sorting of data was developed on the third page of the website(i.e.Best Places page). Here on this page, I have used some restaurant data, which is stored in the js file and used some button options to fetch the cuisine category for the user to select and get the data filtered according to the chosen one.
Assets: I have used a folder named Assets to store the images that have been used in several parts of the website.
Challenges: The challenge I faced while developing the website was to re-arrange the API-fetched information according to the existing data in that API link. and also, in addition to that, the API link which I am currently using is registered and subscribed with my email. So after many testing attempts, I found a glitch in getting API-related data on the page as my subscription limit of using was completed. Again I registered it with another email account to ensure it works well. Balancing both designing effectively and maintaining the given time limit. 
As a part of my contribution to this project, I have gone through all the 
websites, videos and news around social media to get some knowledge on how similar websites are being used. Also, I have followed some of my 
bachelor's books on web design.
Skills Learnt:
In the development process, as part of researching other websites and notes, I've learnt many new things such as routing Pages, Hooks called (userState, and userEffect), different and amazing packages for the design of the website, validations using react, Layout using flex boxes and grids, Targeting different devices with media Queries, adding positioning elements and many more in the react js. 

IMPORTANT NOTE: API-KEY which i used is registsered for limit number of uses.
